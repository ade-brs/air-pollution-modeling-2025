# Air Pollution Modeling in Transport Stations (2024–2025)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and modeling of air pollution levels in Paris metro stations using real environmental data.
The goal is to understand, model, and simulate the spatial diffusion of pollution within a structured transport network.

The project combines data analysis, graph theory, machine learning, and spectral analysis to support decision-making for public transport and urban air quality management.
